Below is the English help originally created by Barrie Ellis and slightly changed by me 
(see  https://switchgaming.blogspot.com/2019/06/mishkinamish-voice-control.html )


1: Microphone. Use a desktop or headset microphone and check your volume is not too loud and not too soft 
using the sound level gauge. MishkinaMish is sensitive to background noise, but you can filter this a bit in training 
(when the red bar appears at the start of training, it's briefly detecting background noise).

2: Training. Prepare to practice with this if wanting full access. 6 separate sounds can be learnt by the system 
(use the English guide above). I'd recommend sticking with the "Eh", "Ah", "Oh" and "Eee" sounds for the arrows at first. 
When training, use a short comfortable pitch you can repeat. Do this until the training gauge fills up, pausing briefly 
between each sound. You can see if other parts of the system are picking up your sounds and clashing.

3: "K" and "Shhh/Chhh". "K" happens whilst you make a whispered kicking-K sound (whispered to make a white-noise sound). 
"Shhh" (I think) happens when you stop after saying "Shhhh/Chhh". For keyboard emulation, I tend to disable these two, 
as they don't work so well for me personally. Otherwise they're used as left-click and drag.

4: Disabling a sound: Double-click the training button to clear a setting, indicated by a "!" yellow circle. 
That will then be ignored. You can have this set up to detect from 1 to 6 sounds in this way.

5: Assigning Mouse or Keys: At the bottom of the Mishkinamish window, you can choose what each of the 6 sounds does. 
The top option will give a corresponding mouse action (e.g. mouse movement up). After that cursor controls for Up, Right, Down, Left.
Then a range of alphanumerics (A-Z 0-9) and other keys. 

The "repeat" tick box makes these pulse on/off rapidly whilst the sound is made. For gaming, it's likely better to have these unticked.
 You'll then get a more continuous "momentary" action that's nicer in practice.

6: Save: Save your training and set-up. You may need several different copies of the Mihkinamish folder to suit different games.

7: Start/Stop: Use this to make the software listen to your commands. Perhaps test in a Notepad to see if the key-presses 
are being issued correctly. Set up your game to match.

8: Run as Administrator: To use this as a mouse, run the software as an administrator (right-click the mishkinamish.exe programme).
 This is needed to use the likes of the On Screen Keyboard. Not essential for all games.
